# a99 Final Project Team 11 - Grocery List App

## Summary 
For our final project, we will be building a grocery list app which allows users to add or delete items from their grocery list. They will be able to access their list through a database we create, and we will attempt to integrate login for users to save and keep progress of their list.

## Installation instructions for grader
